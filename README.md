Employee Attrition Risk Prediction
Project Overview
This repository contains a project focused on predicting employee attrition risk. The goal is to analyze employee data and build a model to identify those at high risk of leaving the organization. By utilizing predictive analytics, the project aims to provide actionable insights to improve employee retention.

Objectives
Analyze Employee Data: Conduct a comprehensive analysis to understand factors contributing to employee attrition.
Build Predictive Model: Develop a machine learning model to forecast the risk of employee turnover.
Provide Insights: Generate recommendations to help organizations mitigate attrition.
Approach
Data Collection: Gather and preprocess employee data, including demographic, job-related, and performance metrics.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
Feature Engineering: Create features that improve the modelâ€™s predictive capability.
Model Training: Train various machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance.
Evaluation: Assess model effectiveness using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Results
The developed model successfully predicts employees at risk of attrition, offering valuable insights for targeted interventions. Key contributing factors to employee turnover have been identified.
